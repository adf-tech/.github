# Adfectatio
They always say you should believe in your dreams and work towards them and Adfectatio is my dream.

## About Us
Right now, Adfectatio is just a dream, the dream child. 
The dream is to develop software (based on AI) that saves lives.
Right now, we don't have the skills to do these things (especially because I'm alone), but maybe in 10 years we can help people with our software. 
Until we can develop this software, we will develop smaller but also helpful software. Be it productivity tools or tools that make developers' lives easier. <br>**We develop it!**
