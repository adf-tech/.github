You see things; and you say 'Why?' But I dream things that never were; and I say 'Why not?'<br>

## About Us
At the moment, Adfectatio is "only" an organization that deals with the development of productivity applications on the web and the development of developer tools. Our vision is bigger, however. Our vision is easiest to explain through a story from our founder:
<br>
"Since childhood, I have been interested in the fire service and rescue service and for a long time it was clear to me that I wanted to work there. However, this changed when I started programming Minecraft plugins at the age of 12 and was immediately fascinated by it. From that point on, it was clear to me that I wanted to be a developer and so I left my previous dream job. At the age of 16, however, I noticed how many opportunities there are to combine both passions through AI, IoT and robotics. That should be the goal of Adfectatio."

It will be a long time before we get to that point. I (Leo) still have to finish school, study and gain a lot of experience. But I believe in my dream!
